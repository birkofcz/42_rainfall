This project is a second in a series of three to elaborate on the basics of cybersecurity, letting us play with various vulnerabilities in binaries, teaching basic principles of reverse engineering.
Even though presented vulnerabilities are pretty basic and mostly not-existent in modern software, the lessons of this project, as we in **Ones & Zeros Social Club** team acknowlegde, is the broader view of how programs work. We learned much about:
1) How binary is executed in the system
2) What is the **stack frame** and how it is constructed
3) What **Global Offset Table** and **Process Linkage Table**
4) Litle training in HEX values reading and how to navigate in memory
5) Work with various debugging and reverse engineering tools, namely **GDB**, **Ghidra** and **Wiremask**.
